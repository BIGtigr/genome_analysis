Gene family analysis with cafe.

Please download the last version of cafe. In this example I just test the v4.0.1 (https://github.com/hahnlab/CAFE/releases/download/v4.0.1/CAFE-4.0.1.tar.gz).

All the running shell in the 01.run.sh.
Notice:
1. give the right tree, which the branch length is the divergence time
2. fix the cafetutorial_run2.sh lambda value from cafetutorial_run1.sh's result


step by step:

python2.7 cafetutorial_mcl2rawcafe.py -i mcloutput -o unfiltered_cafe_input.txt -sp "Cow Dog Goa Hom Hor Oam Opo Pig She"       ### -sp species that contained in the mcl output file

python2.7 cafetutorial_clade_and_size_filter.py -i unfiltered_cafe_input.txt -o filtered_cafe_input.txt -s

cafe cafetutorial_run1.sh

cafe cafetutorial_run2.sh  ### remember the lambda value from cafetutorial_run1.sh's result
